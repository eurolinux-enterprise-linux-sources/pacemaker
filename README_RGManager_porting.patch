-This directory used contain several parts related to the procedure of
+Pacemaker used to provide several tools related to the procedure of
 cluster stacks/configuration migration, in particular and as the directory
 name suggests: from (CMAN+RGManager)-based stack of HA components to
 the (Corosync+Pacemaker)-based one.

 In case any dependencies on previously offered bits arose as time was
 passing by, a mapping to the clufter-provided alternatives is provided:
 
-* `ccs2cib.in` resulting in `ccs2cib` conversion launcher
+* `ccs2cib` conversion launcher
   - use `clufter ccs2pcs` (perhaps with some switches) and wrap it with
     some usage-specific script if suitable
-* `ccs_flatten.c` and the rest of C-files resulting in `ccs_flatten` binary
+* `ccs_flatten` binary
   - you can find the same modulo few modifications in `ccs-flatten`
     subdirectory within the released tarballs or repo itself
     and the resulting binary is a crucial part of clufter installation
-* `cluconf2cib.xsl`
-  - deprecated in favor of multiple, sequentially chained XSL stylesheets
-    decomposed into tree-like structure (refer to `filters/cluster`
-    subdirectory but beware, it is accompanied with transformations for
-    various other purposes)
-* `disable_rgmanager.c` resulting in `disable_rgmanager` utility
+* `disable_rgmanager` utility
   - use `clufter ccs-disable-rg` (since `clufter-0.12.0`)
-* `tests` subdirectory
-  - configs have been put under `tests/cluster.conf/orig` in clufter repo

+Clufter was provided as a technology preview in RHEL 6.8, and is
+supported as of RHEL 6.9.
