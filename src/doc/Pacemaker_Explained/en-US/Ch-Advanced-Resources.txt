== Groups - A Syntactic Shortcut ==
indexterm:[Group Resources]
indexterm:[Resource,Groups]


One of the most common elements of a cluster is a set of resources
that need to be located together, start sequentially, and stop in the
reverse order.  To simplify this configuration, we support the concept
of groups.

.A group of two primitive resources
======
[source,XML]
-------
<group id="shortcut">
   <primitive id="Public-IP" class="ocf" type="IPaddr" provider="heartbeat">
    <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip">
       <nvpair id="public-ip-addr" name="ip" value="192.0.2.2"/>
    </instance_attributes>
   </primitive>
   <primitive id="Email" class="lsb" type="exim"/>
</group> 
-------
======


Although the example above contains only two resources, there is no
limit to the number of resources a group can contain.  The example is
also sufficient to explain the fundamental properties of a group:

* Resources are started in the order they appear in (+Public-IP+
  first, then +Email+)
* Resources are stopped in the reverse order to which they appear in
  (+Email+ first, then +Public-IP+)

If a resource in the group can't run anywhere, then nothing after that
is allowed to run, too.

* If +Public-IP+ can't run anywhere, neither can +Email+;
* but if +Email+ can't run anywhere, this does not affect +Public-IP+
  in any way

The group above is logically equivalent to writing:

.How the cluster sees a group resource
======
[source,XML]
-------
<configuration>
   <resources>
    <primitive id="Public-IP" class="ocf" type="IPaddr" provider="heartbeat">
     <instance_attributes id="params-public-ip">
        <nvpair id="public-ip-addr" name="ip" value="192.0.2.2"/>
     </instance_attributes>
    </primitive>
    <primitive id="Email" class="lsb" type="exim"/>
   </resources>
   <constraints>
      <rsc_colocation id="xxx" rsc="Email" with-rsc="Public-IP" score="INFINITY"/>
      <rsc_order id="yyy" first="Public-IP" then="Email"/>
   </constraints>
</configuration> 
-------
======

Obviously as the group grows bigger, the reduced configuration effort
can become significant.

Another (typical) example of a group is a DRBD volume, the filesystem
mount, an IP address, and an application that uses them.

|=========================================================

=== Group Options ===

Groups inherit the +priority+, +target-role+, and +is-managed+ properties
from primitive resources. See <<s-resource-options>> for information about
those properties.

=== Group Instance Attributes ===

Groups have no instance attributes. However, any that are set for the group
object will be inherited by the group's children.

=== Group Contents ===

Groups may only contain a collection of cluster resources (see
<<primitive-resource>>).  To refer to a child of a group resource, just use
the child's +id+ instead of the group's.

=== Group Constraints ===

Although it is possible to reference a group's children in
constraints, it is usually preferable to reference the group itself.

.Some constraints involving groups
======
[source,XML]
-------
<constraints>
    <rsc_location id="group-prefers-node1" rsc="shortcut" node="node1" score="500"/>
    <rsc_colocation id="webserver-with-group" rsc="Webserver" with-rsc="shortcut"/>
    <rsc_order id="start-group-then-webserver" first="Webserver" then="shortcut"/>
</constraints> 
-------
======

=== Group Stickiness ===
indexterm:[resource-stickiness,Groups]

Stickiness, the measure of how much a resource wants to stay where it
is, is additive in groups.  Every active resource of the group will
contribute its stickiness value to the group's total.  So if the
default +resource-stickiness+ is 100, and a group has seven members,
five of which are active, then the group as a whole will prefer its
current location with a score of 500.

[[s-resource-clone]]
== Clones - Resources That Get Active on Multiple Hosts ==
indexterm:[Clone Resources]
indexterm:[Resource,Clones]

Clones were initially conceived as a convenient way to start multiple
instances of an IP address resource and have them distributed throughout the
cluster for load balancing.  They have turned out to quite useful for
a number of purposes including integrating with the Distributed Lock Manager
(used by many cluster filesystems), the fencing subsystem, and OCFS2.

You can clone any resource, provided the resource agent supports it.

Three types of cloned resources exist:

* Anonymous
* Globally unique
* Stateful

'Anonymous' clones are the simplest.  These behave
completely identically everywhere they are running.  Because of this,
there can be only one copy of an anonymous clone active per machine.
      
'Globally unique' clones are distinct entities.  A copy of the clone
running on one machine is not equivalent to another instance on
another node, nor would any two copies on the same node be
equivalent.

'Stateful' clones are covered later in <<s-resource-multistate>>.

|=========================================================

=== Clone Instance Attributes ===

Clones have no instance attributes; however, any that are set here
will be inherited by the clone's children.

=== Clone Contents ===

Clones must contain exactly one primitive or group resource.

[WARNING]
You should never reference the name of a clone's child.
If you think you need to do this, you probably need to re-evaluate your design.

=== Clone Constraints ===

In most cases, a clone will have a single copy on each active cluster
node.  If this is not the case, you can indicate which nodes the
cluster should preferentially assign copies to with resource location
constraints.  These constraints are written no differently from those
for primitive resources except that the clone's +id+ is used.

.Some constraints involving clones
======
[source,XML]
-------
<constraints>
    <rsc_location id="clone-prefers-node1" rsc="apache-clone" node="node1" score="500"/>
    <rsc_colocation id="stats-with-clone" rsc="apache-stats" with="apache-clone"/>
    <rsc_order id="start-clone-then-stats" first="apache-clone" then="apache-stats"/>
</constraints> 
-------
======

Ordering constraints behave slightly differently for clones.  In the
example above, +apache-stats+ will wait until all copies of +apache-clone+
that need to be started have done so before being started itself.
Only if _no_ copies can be started will +apache-stats+ be prevented
from being active.  Additionally, the clone will wait for
+apache-stats+ to be stopped before stopping itself.

Colocation of a primitive or group resource with a clone means that
the resource can run on any machine with an active copy of the clone.
The cluster will choose a copy based on where the clone is running and
the resource's own location preferences.

Colocation between clones is also possible.  If one clone +A+ is colocated
with another clone +B+, the set of allowed locations for +A+ is limited to
nodes on which +B+ is (or will be) active.  Placement is then performed
normally.

[[s-clone-stickiness]]
=== Clone Stickiness ===

indexterm:[resource-stickiness,Clones]

To achieve a stable allocation pattern, clones are slightly sticky by
default.  If no value for +resource-stickiness+ is provided, the clone
will use a value of 1.  Being a small value, it causes minimal
disturbance to the score calculations of other resources but is enough
to prevent Pacemaker from needlessly moving copies around the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
For globally unique clones, this may result in multiple instances of the
clone staying on a single node, even after another eligible node becomes
active (for example, after being put into standby mode then made active again).
If you do not want this behavior, specify a +resource-stickiness+ of 0
for the clone temporarily and let the cluster adjust, then set it back
to 1 if you want the default behavior to apply again.
====

=== Clone Resource Agent Requirements ===

Any resource can be used as an anonymous clone, as it requires no
additional support from the resource agent.  Whether it makes sense to
do so depends on your resource and its resource agent.

Globally unique clones do require some additional support in the
resource agent.  In particular, it must only respond with
+$\{OCF_SUCCESS}+ if the node has that exact instance active.  All
other probes for instances of the clone should result in
+$\{OCF_NOT_RUNNING}+ (or one of the other OCF error codes if
they are failed).

Individual instances of a clone are identified by appending a colon and a
numerical offset, e.g. +apache:2+.

Resource agents can find out how many copies there are by examining
the +OCF_RESKEY_CRM_meta_clone_max+ environment variable and which
copy it is by examining +OCF_RESKEY_CRM_meta_clone+.

The resource agent must not make any assumptions (based on
+OCF_RESKEY_CRM_meta_clone+) about which numerical instances are active.  In
particular, the list of active copies will not always be an unbroken
sequence, nor always start at 0.

==== Clone Notifications ====

Supporting notifications requires the +notify+ action to be
implemented.  If supported, the notify action will be passed a
number of extra variables which, when combined with additional
context, can be used to calculate the current state of the cluster and
what is about to happen to it.

|Nodes on which resources are running
 indexterm:[Environment Variable,OCF_RESKEY_CRM_meta_notify_,active_uname]
 indexterm:[active_uname,Notification Environment Variable]

|=========================================================

The variables come in pairs, such as
+OCF_RESKEY_CRM_meta_notify_start_resource+ and
+OCF_RESKEY_CRM_meta_notify_start_uname+ and should be treated as an
array of whitespace-separated elements.

+OCF_RESKEY_CRM_meta_notify_inactive_resource+ is an exception as the
matching +uname+ variable does not exist since inactive resources
are not running on any node.

Thus in order to indicate that +clone:0+ will be started on +sles-1+,
+clone:2+ will be started on +sles-3+, and +clone:3+ will be started
on +sles-2+, the cluster would set

== Multi-state - Resources That Have Multiple Modes ==

indexterm:[Multi-state Resources]
indexterm:[Resource,Multi-state]

Multi-state resources are a specialization of clone resources; please
ensure you understand <<s-resource-clone>> before continuing!

Multi-state resources allow the instances to be in one of two operating modes
(called 'roles'). The roles are called 'master' and 'slave', but can mean
whatever you wish them to mean. The only limitation is that when an instance is
started, it must come up in the slave role.

=== Multi-state Instance Attributes ===

Multi-state resources have no instance attributes; however, any that
are set here will be inherited by a master's children.

=== Multi-state Contents ===

Masters must contain exactly one primitive or group resource.

[WARNING]
You should never reference the name of a master's child.
If you think you need to do this, you probably need to re-evaluate your design.

=== Monitoring Multi-State Resources ===

The usual monitor actions are insufficient to monitor a multi-state resource,
because pacemaker needs to verify not only that the resource is active, but
also that its actual role matches its intended one.

Define two monitoring actions: the usual one will cover the slave role,
and an additional one with +role="master"+ will cover the master role.

.Monitoring both states of a multi-state resource
======
[source,XML]
-------
<master id="myMasterRsc">
   <primitive id="myRsc" class="ocf" type="myApp" provider="myCorp">
    <operations>
     <op id="public-ip-slave-check" name="monitor" interval="60"/>
     <op id="public-ip-master-check" name="monitor" interval="61" role="Master"/>
    </operations>
   </primitive>
</master> 
-------
======

[IMPORTANT]
===========
It is crucial that _every_ monitor operation has a different interval!
Pacemaker currently differentiates between operations
only by resource and interval; so if (for example) a master/slave resource had
the same monitor interval for both roles, Pacemaker would ignore the
role when checking the status -- which would cause unexpected return
codes, and therefore unnecessary complications.
===========

=== Multi-state Constraints ===

In most cases, multi-state resources will have a single copy on each
active cluster node.  If this is not the case, you can indicate which
nodes the cluster should preferentially assign copies to with resource
location constraints.  These constraints are written no differently from
those for primitive resources except that the master's +id+ is used.

When considering multi-state resources in constraints, for most
purposes it is sufficient to treat them as clones. The exception is
that the +first-action+ and/or +then-action+ fields for ordering constraints
may be set to +promote+ or +demote+ to constrain the master role,
and colocation constraints may contain +rsc-role+ and/or +with-rsc-role+
fields.

   <rsc_colocation id="backup-with-db-slave" rsc="backup"

   <rsc_order id="promote-db-then-app" first="database" first-action="promote"
     then="myApp" then-action="start"/>
</constraints> 
-------
======

In the example above, +myApp+ will wait until one of the database
copies has been started and promoted to master before being started
itself on the same node.  Only if no copies can be promoted will +myApp+ be
prevented from being active.  Additionally, the cluster will wait for
+myApp+ to be stopped before demoting the database.

Colocation of a primitive or group resource with a multi-state
resource means that it can run on any machine with an active copy of
the multi-state resource that has the specified role (+master+ or
+slave+).  In the example above, the cluster will choose a location based on
where database is running as a +master+, and if there are multiple
+master+ instances it will also factor in +myApp+'s own location
preferences when deciding which location to choose.

Colocation with regular clones and other multi-state resources is also
possible.  In such cases, the set of allowed locations for the +rsc+
clone is (after role filtering) limited to nodes on which the
+with-rsc+ multi-state resource is (or will be) in the specified role.
Placement is then performed as normal.

have been promoted before they can start.


=== Multi-state Stickiness ===

indexterm:[resource-stickiness,Multi-State]
As with regular clones, multi-state resources are
slightly sticky by default. See <<s-clone-stickiness>> for details.

[[s-master-scores]]
=== Which Resource Instance is Promoted ===

During the start operation, most resource agents should call
the `crm_master` utility.  This tool automatically detects both the
resource and host and should be used to set a preference for being
promoted.  Based on this, +master-max+, and +master-node-max+, the
instance(s) with the highest preference will be promoted.

An alternative is to create a location constraint that
indicates which nodes are most preferred as masters.

<rsc_location id="master-location" rsc="myMasterRsc">

    </rule>
</rsc_location> 
-------
======

=== Requirements for Multi-state Resource Agents ===

Since multi-state resources are an extension of cloned resources, all
the requirements for resource agents that support clones are also requirements
for resource agents that support multi-state resources.

Additionally, multi-state resources require two extra
actions, +demote+ and +promote+, which are responsible for
changing the state of the resource.  Like +start+ and +stop+, they
should return +$\{OCF_SUCCESS}+ if they completed successfully or a
relevant error code if they did not.

The states can mean whatever you wish, but when the resource is
started, it must come up in the mode called +slave+.  From there the
cluster will decide which instances to promote to +master+.

In addition to the clone requirements for monitor actions, agents must
also _accurately_ report which state they are in.  The cluster relies
on the agent to report its status (including role) accurately and does
not indicate to the agent what role it currently believes it to be in.

==== Multi-state Notifications ====

Like clones, supporting notifications requires the +notify+ action to
be implemented.  If supported, the notify action will be passed a
number of extra variables which, when combined with additional
context, can be used to calculate the current state of the cluster and
what is about to happen to it.

 for example, when the container uses the host's network rather than
 +ip-range-start+ (in which case +replicas-per-host+ must be 1), or when the
 bundle may run on a Pacemaker Remote node that is already listening on the
 default port. Any PCMK_remote_port environment variable set on the host or in

|=========================================================

[NOTE]
====
Pacemaker does not define the behavior if the source directory does not already
exist on the host. However, it is expected that the container technology and/or
its resource agent will create the source directory in that case.
====

[NOTE]
====
If the bundle contains a +primitive+,
Pacemaker will automatically map the equivalent of
+source-dir=/etc/pacemaker/authkey target-dir=/etc/pacemaker/authkey+
and +source-dir-root=/var/log/pacemaker/bundles target-dir=/var/log+ into the
container, so it is not necessary to specify those paths in a
+storage-mapping+.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The +PCMK_authkey_location+ environment variable must not be set to anything
other than the default of `/etc/pacemaker/authkey` on any node in the cluster.
====

=== Bundle Primitive ===

A bundle may optionally contain one +<primitive>+ resource
(see <<s-resource-primitive>>). The primitive may have operations,
instance attributes and meta-attributes defined, as usual.

If a bundle contains a primitive resource, the container image must include
the Pacemaker Remote daemon, and at least one of +ip-range-start+ or
+control-port+ must be configured in the bundle. Pacemaker will create an
implicit +ocf:pacemaker:remote+ resource for the connection, launch
Pacemaker Remote within the container, and monitor and manage the primitive
resource via Pacemaker Remote.

If the bundle has more than one container instance (replica), the primitive
resource will function as an implicit clone (see <<s-resource-clone>>) --
a multistate clone if the bundle has +masters+ greater than zero
(see <<s-resource-multistate>>).
 
[IMPORTANT]
====
Containers in bundles with a +primitive+ must have an accessible networking
environment, so that Pacemaker on the cluster nodes can contact
Pacemaker Remote inside the container. For example, the Docker option
`--net=none` should not be used with a +primitive+. The default (using a
distinct network space inside the container) works in combination with
+ip-range-start+. If the Docker option `--net=host` is used (making the
container share the host's network space), a unique +control-port+ should be
specified for each bundle. Any firewall must allow access to the
+control-port+.
====

[[s-bundle-attributes]]
=== Bundle Node Attributes ===

If the bundle has a +primitive+, the primitive's resource agent may want to set
node attributes such as <<s-master-scores,master scores>>. However, with
containers, it is not apparent which node should get the attribute.

If the container uses shared storage that is the same no matter which node the
container is hosted on, then it is appropriate to use the master score on the
bundle node itself.

On the other hand, if the container uses storage exported from the underlying host,
then it may be more appropriate to use the master score on the underlying host.

Since this depends on the particular situation, the
+container-attribute-target+ resource meta-attribute allows the user to specify
which approach to use. If it is set to +host+, then user-defined node attributes
will be checked on the underlying host. If it is anything else, the local node
(in this case the bundle node) is used as usual.

This only applies to user-defined attributes; the cluster will always check the
local node for cluster-defined attributes such as +#uname+.

If +container-attribute-target+ is +host+, the cluster will pass additional
environment variables to the primitive's resource agent that allow it to set
node attributes appropriately: +container_attribute_target+ (identical to the
meta-attribute value) and +physical_host+ (the name of the underlying host).

[NOTE]
====
It is up to the resource agent to check for the additional variables and use
them when setting node attributes.
====

=== Bundle Meta-Attributes ===

Any meta-attribute set on a bundle will be inherited by the bundle's
primitive and any resources implicitly created by Pacemaker for the bundle.

This includes options such as +priority+, +target-role+, and +is-managed+. See
<<s-resource-options>> for more information.

=== Limitations of Bundles ===

Restarting pacemaker while a bundle is unmanaged or the cluster is in
maintenance mode may cause the bundle to fail.

Bundles may not be cloned or included in groups. This includes the bundle's
primitive and any resources implicitly created by Pacemaker for the bundle.

Bundles do not have instance attributes, utilization attributes, or operations,
though a bundle's primitive may have them.

A bundle with a primitive can run on a Pacemaker Remote node only if the bundle
uses a distinct +control-port+.
