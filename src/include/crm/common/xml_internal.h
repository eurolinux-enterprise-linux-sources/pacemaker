 * \brief Base for directing lib{xml2,xslt} log into standard libqb backend
 *
 * This macro implements the core of what can be needed for directing
 * libxml2 or libxslt error messaging into standard, preconfigured
 * libqb-backed log stream.
 *
 * It's a bit unfortunate that libxml2 (and more sparsely, also libxslt)
 * emits a single message by chunks (location is emitted separatedly from
 * the message itself), so we have to take the effort to combine these
 * chunks back to single message.  Whether to do this or not is driven
 * with \p dechunk toggle.
 *
 * The form of a macro was chosen for implicit deriving of __FILE__, etc.
 * and also because static dechunking buffer should be differentiated per
 * library (here we assume different functions referring to this macro
 * will not ever be using both at once), preferably also per-library
 * context of use to avoid clashes altogether.
 *
 * Note that we cannot use qb_logt, because callsite data have to be known
 * at the moment of compilation, which it is not always the case -- xml_log
 * (and unfortunately there's no clear explanation of the fail to compile).
 *
 * Also note that there's no explicit guard against said libraries producing
 * never-newline-terminated chunks (which would just keep consuming memory),
 * as it's quite improbable.  Termination of the program in between the
 * same-message chunks will raise a flag with valgrind and the likes, though.
 *
 * \param[in] priority Syslog priority for the message to be logged
 * \param[in] dechunk  Whether to dechunk new-line terminated message
 * \param[in] postemit Code to be executed once message is sent out
 * \param[in] prefix   How to prefix the message or NULL for raw passing
 * \param[in] fmt      Format string as with printf-like functions
 * \param[in] ap       Variable argument list to supplement \p fmt format string
