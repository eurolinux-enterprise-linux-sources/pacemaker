Current cluster status:
Node node1 (1): UNCLEAN (offline)
Online: [ node2 ]
RemoteOnline: [ remote1 ]

 remote1	(ocf::pacemaker:remote):	Started node1 (UNCLEAN)
 killer	(stonith:fence_xvm):	Started node2
 rsc1	(ocf::pacemaker:Dummy):	Started remote1
 Master/Slave Set: rsc2-master [rsc2]
     rsc2	(ocf::pacemaker:Stateful):	Master node1 (UNCLEAN)
     Masters: [ node2 ]
     Stopped: [ remote1 ]

Transition Summary:
 * Fence (reboot) remote1 'resources are active and the connection is unrecoverable'
 * Fence (reboot) node1 'peer is no longer part of the cluster'
 * Stop       remote1     (            node1 )   due to node availability
 * Restart    killer      (            node2 )   due to resource definition change
 * Move       rsc1        ( remote1 -> node2 )  
 * Stop       rsc2:0      (     Master node1 )   due to node availability
